ðŸ“Œ Capstone Project Description â€“ NopCommerce Test Automation

As part of my Wipro Capstone Project, I worked on the end-to-end functional and automation testing of the nopCommerce e-commerce application (https://demo.nopcommerce.com

Gift Cards & Digital Downloads

Created a Test Plan, RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix), and Defect Reports.

Automated critical flows using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Maven, and integrated Cucumber (BDD) for readability and reporting.

Managed test data through MS Excel and tracked defects using Jira.

Performed cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

Validated both positive and negative scenarios (e.g., valid checkout vs. empty cart checkout, valid vs. invalid search).

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies:

Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber (BDD), Apache Maven, MS Excel, Jira

Languages: Java (for Selenium automation)
